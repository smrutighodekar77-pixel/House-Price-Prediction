# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Predict house selling prices using Machine Learning based on property features such as living area, neighborhood, overall quality, garage capacity, basement area, and many other housing characteristics.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment through an interactive Streamlit web application.
